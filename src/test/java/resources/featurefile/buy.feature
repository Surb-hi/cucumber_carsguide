Feature: Search functionality
  As user I want to test search functionality

  Scenario Outline: : Search the buy car with model
    Given           I am on homepage
    When            I mouse hover on “buy+sell” tab
    And              I click ‘Search Cars’ link
    Then            I navigate to "New & Used Car Search - carsguide" page
    And             I select make "<make>"
    And             I select model "<model>"
    And             I select location "<location>"
    And             I select price "<price>"
    And             I click on Find My Next Car tab
    Then            I should see the make "<make>" in results

    Examples:
      | make    | model     | location            | price   |
      | Audi    | Any Model | NSW - All           | $25,000 |
